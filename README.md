### Hi, I'm Annesa! :worm: 
I'm a second-year **Informatics** student at **UC Irvine**, and I use she/her pronouns.
- I'm a beginner at coding in Python, Java, and HTML + CSS
- My other areas of interest include digital design, linguistics, cognitive science, and anthropology

Other than that, I don't have much of anything to write about . . . but I hopefully will soon as I learn more!  

You can reach me on discord at annesa#0726 or on instagram [@annesatran](https://www.instagram.com/annesatran/)
